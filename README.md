# pollution-prediction-using-deep-learning
trained a machine learning model on 45000 data points that had hourly measurements of weather data such as dew, snow, rain, wind speed,  wind direction, pressure and pollution. The model predicts pollution based on previous 11 datapoints. Currently model provides satisfactory performance with RMSE score of 0.064.
